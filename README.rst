Dynamical evolution of complex systems.

This package provides an interface to a set of ODE solvers for solving
dynamical time-evolution problems. The original application was quantum
dynamics via Gross-Pitaevski equations (GPE) and superfluid density
functional theory (TDDFT), but the code is quite general and should be
able to be easily used for a variety of problems.

Currently the codes only use fixed time-step method (not adaptive).
