    "Presently you must manually install the ``pytimeode`` package or include it with your project.  I currently recommend including it as a subrepository managed by [myrepos](http://myrepos.branchable.com).  For example, I typically use the following line in a top-level ``.mrconfig`` file (use the second checkout if you access bitbucket with ssh keys):\n",

    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then running ``mr checkout`` from the toplevel will pull and update the latest version of ``pytimeode`` and put it in ``_ext/pytimeode``.  I then create and add a symlink to this in the top level (and add ``_ext`` to my ``.hgignore`` file) so that I can use the ``pytimeode`` module directly:\n",
